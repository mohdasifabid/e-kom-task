### E-Commerce App

This is a mock E-commerce web application built using Next.js, React Query, Context API, React Icons, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides functionalities such as user authentication (login, signup), browsing through categories, private routes for authenticated users, and more.

### Features

- **Login/Signup**: Users can create an account or login using their credentials.
- **Categories**: Users can browse products by different categories.
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication is implemented.
- **Private Route**: Certain routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.

### Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and routing.
- **React Query**: For managing server state and fetching data.
- **Context API**: For global state management.
- **React Icons**: Icons library for UI.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

### Mock APIs

Mock APIs are used to simulate server-side interactions. These APIs mimic the behavior of real APIs but do not actually send or receive data to/from a server. Instead, they generate mock data locally.
